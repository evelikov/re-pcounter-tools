Event# 1
Name      = l1_local_load_hit
Longdesc  = Number of cache lines that hit in L1 cache for local memory load
            accesses. In case of perfect coalescing this increments by 1, 2,
            and 4 for 32, 64 and 128 bit accesses by a warp respectively.

Event# 2
Name      = l1_local_load_miss
Longdesc  = Number of cache lines that miss in L1 cache for local memory load
            accesses. In case of perfect coalescing this increments by 1, 2,
            and 4 for 32, 64 and 128 bit accesses by a warp respectively.

Event# 3
Name      = l1_local_store_hit

All of these events use the quad event mode state described below and
the QUAD_ACK_TRIGGER register :
register: 18009c, value: 00040002, mask: ffffffff
    ==> PCOUNTER.GPC_DOM[0].CTRL[0] => {
        MODE = QUAD                     |
        CTR_MODE = SIMPLE               |
        EVENT_CTR_PERIOD = ONE          |
        EVENT_IMPORT_MODE = CONTINUOUS  |
