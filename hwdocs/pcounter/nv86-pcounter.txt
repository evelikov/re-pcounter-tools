=== setup_primitive_count ===

Returns the number of primitives processed in the geometry subsystem. This
experiments counts points, lines and triangles. To count only triangles,
use the setup_triangle_count counter. Balance these counts with the number
of pixels being drawn to see if you could simplify your geometry and use
bump/displacement maps, for example.

=== setup_point_count ===

The number of points seen by the primitive setup unit (just before
rasterization).

=== setup_line_count ===

The number of lines seen by the primitive setup unit (just before
rasterization).

=== setup_triangle_count ===

Returns the number of triangles processed in the geometry subsystem.
