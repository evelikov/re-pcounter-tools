=== setup_primitive_count ===

Returns the number of primitives processed in the geometry subsystem. This
experiments counts points, lines and triangles. To count only triangles,
use the setup_triangle_count counter. Balance these counts with the number
of pixels being drawn to see if you could simplify your geometry and use
bump/displacement maps, for example.

=== setup_point_count ===

The number of points seen by the primitive setup unit (just before
rasterization).

=== setup_line_count ===

The number of lines seen by the primitive setup unit (just before
rasterization).

=== setup_triangle_count ===

Returns the number of triangles processed in the geometry subsystem.

=== setup_primitive_culled_count ===

Returns the number of primitives culled in primitive setup. If you are
performing viewport culling, this gives you an indication of the accuracy
of the algorithm being used, and can give you and idea if you need to improves
this culling. This includes primitives culled when using backface culling.
Drawing a fully visible sphere on the screen should cull half of the triangles
if backface culling is tuerned on and all the triangles are ordered
consistently (CW or CCW).
